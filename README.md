# Tuxedo

## Documentation-driven development

Implementing technical and scientific algorithms in code starts with a thorough understanding of the problem
that is being solved and how a particular algorithm solves that problem. Tuxedo provides a framework for
transforming theory found in published books and technical papers into testable, usable code.
